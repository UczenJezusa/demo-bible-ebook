## Demo: Bible Text Formatter

Python scripts for formatting Bible text.
The main script enlarges the first letter of the first verse of each chapter in the HTML file, while helper modules handle parsing and text styling.

A sample PDF showing the visual effect of the formatting is included [here](examples/Biblia%20Gda≈Ñska%201632.pdf). The scripts modify HTML file only.
